# Earthquake-location
This repository contain different method to locate earthquake in a higly simplified environment. 

### There are 3 scripts:
**gradient_descent.py**: this module contains function to compute gradient descent through exploration algorithms.

**graph.py**: this module contain functions to plot the state of the search and the history of the localisation of the earthquake.

**example.py**: this script contain exemples on how to use the functions from gradient_descent.py and graph.py.
